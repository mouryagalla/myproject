In this example playbook, we assume that the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector is installed on the target host and that the agent_config.yaml file is located at /etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml. You can adjust the agent_config_path variable to point to the correct path for your installation.

The playbook includes four tasks:

The first task adds or edits the processors.batch.timeout configuration to 10s using yq. If the configuration already exists, it will be overwritten with the new value.

The second task deletes the receivers.otlp.protocols.http.endpoint configuration using yq.

The third task adds a new configuration for the health_check extension using a path expression in yq. This will add a new health_check section to the extensions section of the configuration file with the specified endpoint.

The fourth task adds a new configuration for two processors using yq with an array. This will add a new batch processor and a memory_limiter processor to the processors section of the configuration file with the specified values.

Each task uses the yq module with various options to perform the necessary changes to the agent_config.yaml file. The path option specifies the path to the file, and the write and backup options ensure that the changes are written to the file and that a backup is created before making the changes.

The yamlarg option specifies that the input and output are in YAML format. The key option is used to specify the key or path to the configuration to add, edit or delete, and the value option is used to specify the new value for an existing or new configuration.

In the third and fourth tasks, the expression option is used instead of the key and value options to specify a more complex change to the configuration. In the third task, the path expression adds a new key and value to the extensions section. In the fourth task, the expression adds

Using CLI,


# Add or edit a configuration using yq
$ /path/to/yq w -i /etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml processors.batch.timeout 10s

# Delete a configuration using yq
$ /path/to/yq w -i /etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml -d receivers.otlp.protocols.http.endpoint

# Add a configuration using yq with a path expression
$ /path/to/yq w -i /etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml '.extensions."health_check" = {"endpoint": "http://localhost:13133/healthz"}'

# Add a configuration using yq with an array
$ /path/to/yq w -i /etc/otel/collector/agent_config.yaml '.processors += [{"batch": {"timeout": "10s"}, "memory_limiter": {"limit_mib": 1024}}]'



yq w -i agent_config.yaml services.metrics.receivers.[+] name_of_receiver


To delete the receiver name under the metrics section of service in the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector agent_config.yaml using yq, you can use the following command:

scss
Copy code
yq w -i agent_config.yaml services.metrics.receivers [*] | select(. != "name_of_receiver")
This command removes the receiver name with the value of name_of_receiver under the metrics section of the service in the agent_config.yaml file.

Note that you will need to replace agent_config.yaml with the path to your actual agent_config.yaml file, and name_of_receiver with the actual name of the receiver you want to delete.


-------------------------

To modify a receiver under the metrics section of service in the Splunk OpenTelemetry Collector agent_config.yaml using yq, you can use the following command:

css
Copy code
yq w -i agent_config.yaml services.metrics.receivers.[receiver_index].parameter_name new_value
This command modifies the value of the parameter_name of the receiver at the specified receiver_index in the metrics section of the service in the agent_config.yaml file.

Here, you need to replace agent_config.yaml with the path to your actual agent_config.yaml file, receiver_index with the index of the receiver you want to modify (starting from 0), parameter_name with the name of the parameter you want to modify, and new_value with the new value that you want to set for the parameter.

For example, to modify the endpoint parameter of the first receiver under the metrics section of the service, you can use the following command:

css
Copy code
yq w -i agent_config.yaml services.metrics.receivers.[0].endpoint new_endpoint_value
This command sets the value of the endpoint parameter of the first receiver under the metrics section of the service to new_endpoint_value.
